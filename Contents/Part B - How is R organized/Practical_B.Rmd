#### Exercises
In this practical we are going to play around with the different types of elements in R. 

---

 1. **Make two vectors: one named `vec1` with values 1 through 6 and one named `vec2` with letters A through F. **

---

 2. **Create two matrices, one from `vec1` and one from `vec2`. The dimensions for both matrices are 3 rows by 2 columns. **

---

3. **Inspect your vectors and matrices. Are all numerical?**

---

4. **Make a matrix from both `vec1` and `vec2` with 6 rows and 2 columns. Inspect this matrix.**


---

5. **Make a dataframe called `dat3` where `vec1` and `vec2` are both columns. Name the columns `V1` and `V2`, respectively. Use function `data.frame()`.**

---

6. **Again, make a dataframe called `dat3b` where `vec1` and `vec2` are both columns. Name the columns `V1` and `V2`, respectively. Use function `as.data.frame()` on the matrix obtained from `Question 4`. **

---

7. **Check if the first column in the data frames from Question 5 and Question 6 are indeed numeric. If not, determine what they are. **

---

8. **Select 1) the third row, 2) the second column and 3) the intersection of these two in the dataframe `dat3` that you have created in Question 4. **

---

9. **Imagine that the first variable `V1` in our dataframe `dat3` is not coded correctly, but actually represents grouping information about cities. Convert the variable to a factor and add the labels Utrecht, New York, London, Singapore, Rome and Cape Town.** 

---

10. **Open the dataset `boys.RData`. You need to download this file and put it in the project folder.**

---

11. **Most packages have datasets included. Since we have not learned to load packages yet, you are presented with such a dataset in a workspace. Open the `boys` dataset (it is from package `mice`, by the way) by typing `boys` in the console, and subsequently by using the function `View()`. ** Tip: To understand the numbers you are looking at look at the documentation by typing `?mice::boys`

---

12. **Find out the dimensions of the `boys` data set and inspect the first and final 6 cases in the data set. **

---

13. **It seems that the `boys` data are sorted based on `age`. Verify this.** 

---

14. **Inspect the `boys` dataset with `str()`. Use one or more functions to find distributional summary information (at least information about the minimum, the maximum, the mean and the median) for all of the variables. Give the standard deviation for `age` and `bmi`. ** Tip: make use of the help (?) and help search (??) functionality in `R`. 

---

15. **Select all boys that are 20 years or older. How many are there?**

---

16. **Select all boys that are older than 19, but younger than 19.5. How many are there?**

---

17. **What is the mean age of boys younger than 15 years of age that do not live in region `north`?**
